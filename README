Data for the years 1994 through 2011 has been cribbed from
http://www.s234171324.websitehome.co.uk/festival_results.htm - accuracy and
completeness depend entirely on that site and its creator, David Sandham. Thanks
David! Data for 2011 and 2013 came from my own notes, having been there at the
ceremony. For 2012, a post by S-J Hall is my sole source. In all cases, manual
transcription has occurred, so errors are a definite possibility - not to
mention inconsistencies.

The G&Ses are not performed equally frequently, but I'm hoping that this won't
make material impact on the stats. Also, the appointed adjudicator changes from
year to year, which quite possibly WILL have impact on the stats, but as I don't
have data on who adjudicated which years, I've omitted that. (It would be useful,
though, to be able to (say) restrict the display to David Turner years, for
instance.)

Not all awards have nominations listed. This may be because none were named, but
it may also be because I just don't have the information. Submissions welcome.

The file format is simple: tab delimited fields. Any number of tabs is a single
delimiter. The first field is either the year or the award; in either case there
will be no other fields. Otherwise, the fields are Show, Company, Role, and
Performer, in that order; obviously not all awards use all fields.
